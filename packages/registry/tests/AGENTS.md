# Registry Tests

- Do not import, depend on, wrap, call, or adapt deleted old-contour packages such as `@agentg/events`, `@agentg/service-directory`,
  `@agentg/database`. If one appears necessary, stop and report the boundary violation before editing code.

- Do not hide material facts from the user. Explicitly disclose API changes,
  signature changes, compatibility paths, fallback behavior, architectural
  violations, failed checks, risky assumptions, and any workaround before or
  when presenting the change.
- Tests in this package cover runner-specific wiring only.
- Registry behavior tests belong to `@agentg/framework`.
- Do not reintroduce local registry, client, or contract tests here.
